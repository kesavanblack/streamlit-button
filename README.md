Streamlit Button
In Streamlit, a button is a UI component that allows users to trigger specific actions or events with a simple click. It's commonly used for submitting forms, running data processing tasks, or toggling between different states within an app.

Key Features:
User Interaction: Buttons capture user input to initiate actions like executing functions, submitting data, or interacting with visualizations.
Conditional Logic: Based on whether the button is clicked or not, different outputs can be generated.
Event Triggering: Buttons can be linked to functions or processes, making them perfect for triggering backend operations like data analysis, machine learning tasks, or downloading reports.
Easy to Use: Simply define the button and its associated logic within a few lines of code using Streamlit's intuitive API.
Buttons in Streamlit enhance interactivity, making applications more dynamic and responsive to user input.




In Streamlit, a button is used to trigger an action when clicked. Here's how you can create and use a button in a Streamlit app:

Basic Usage:
python
Copy code
import streamlit as st

# Create a button
if st.button('Click Me'):
    st.write('Button was clicked!')
Example with Conditional Logic:
You can use a button to control different actions based on whether it's clicked or not:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st

# Create a button with conditional logic
if st.button('Submit'):
    st.write('You clicked the Submit button!')
else:
    st.write('Click the button to submit.')
Example with a Callback:
Buttons are often used to trigger data processing, file downloads, or API calls:

python
Copy code
import streamlit as st

def process_data():
    st.write("Data is being processed...")

# Button triggers a function
if st.button('Process Data'):
    process_data()
Buttons in Streamlit reset their state after every interaction, so the code inside the if statement runs only when the button is clicked.
